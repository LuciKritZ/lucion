# Lucion

[Lucion](https://lucion.vercel.app/) is a team workspace inspired by [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). A connected workspace for better, efficient, and faster work. It is created by [LuciKritZ](https://github.com/LuciKritZ). Lucion is based on the following technologies:

1. [Next.js 14](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
2. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
3. [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
4. [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/)
5. [Edgestore](https://edgestore.dev/)
6. [Heap Analytics](https://heapanalytics.com/)

## Getting Started

### Local Machine

1. Have both [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

3. Run `npx convex dev`

   - This will start a convex backend.
   - For more information on Convex, refer this [README.md](convex/README.md)

4. Run `npm run dev` in a separate terminal
   - This will start the development server.

## Typescript

This project is developed completely in TypeScript.

## Engines

Consult the `"engines"` section of package.json for the recommended version of **node**, and **npm**.

### What if my node or npm version is not accepted?

- Compatible versions of node and npm are tightly coupled; if one or the other is not compatible, run: `nvm install`.
